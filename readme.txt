Input video should be titled 'input.mp4' and placed in the Face unwraper folder.

As program runs, individual frames will be saved to the frames and processed frames folder but will be deleted once the program is finished.

Final image will save as 'out.jpg'.


The more stable the input video, the better the final image will be.
